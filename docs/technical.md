## Software Architecture üóúÔ∏è
The Software Architecture describes the subsystems and components of the software by presenting a number of architectural views. Each view shows a different aspect of the system to address different concerns. These are as follows:

### 1. Context View
The Context view of a system defines the relationships, dependencies, and interactions between the system and its environment‚Äîthe people, systems, and external entities with which it interacts. It defines what the system does and does not do; where the boundaries are between it and the outside world; and how the system interacts with other systems, organizations, and people across these boundaries.
